### Enhancements

-   [ ] Make the webRTC more stable

-   [ ] Add sounds / music / audio
-   [ ] Spectators? players not in a team.
-   [ ] Add CaptCha to secure connection to firebase
-   [ ] Adding a PageHeader might be nice/needed for supporting PWAs
-   [ ] Having a notification / message / alert when getting disconnected?

### Bugs / Warnings

-   [ ] v-auto-animate in the lobby, probably because I have two nested v-auto-animate.
